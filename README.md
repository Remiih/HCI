| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|**1. User Authentication & Authorization**|||**20**|
|**Authentication**|Secure user login with proper password handling (e.g., hashing).||10: Secure authentication (password hashing, secure login process).<br>8: Authentication exists but lacks proper security (e.g., weak password handling).<br>5: Basic authentication with no password hashing.<br>0: No authentication implemented.|
|**Authorization**|Role-based or permission-based access control to restrict access to resources.||10: Fully implemented with proper access control for different roles.<br>8: Authorization implemented, but lacks fine-grained access.<br>5: Basic access control.<br>0: No access control implemented.|
|**2. CRUD Operations for Data Management**|||**15**|
|**Create Operation**|Secure creation of records (e.g., new users, data entries) with validation and proper access control.||5: Fully functional with validation and security.<br>3: Functional but lacks validation or security.<br>0: No create functionality.|
|**Read Operation**|Proper retrieval of data with appropriate access control, and pagination if needed.||5: Fully functional with pagination and access control.<br>3: Functional but lacks pagination or access control.<br>0: No read functionality.|
|**Update & Delete Operations**|Secure and validated update and delete functionality with proper authorization checks.||5: Secure and functional update and delete operations.<br>3: Works but lacks security checks or validation.<br>0: No update or delete functionality.|
|**3. Data Validation**|||**10**|

|**Encryption**|Ensuring sensitive data is encrypted or hashed (e.g., passwords, personal data).||10: Full encryption or hashing for sensitive data.<br>6: Partial or flawed encryption.<br>0: No encryption applied.|
|**Access Control**|Fine-grained control over who can access specific data or perform certain actions.||5: Access control properly implemented for each action.<br>3: Basic access control.<br>0: No access control.|
|**Logging & Monitoring**|Logging of critical actions (e.g., login attempts, data modifications) and monitoring for suspicious activity.||5: Full logging and monitoring for security-critical actions.<br>3: Logging exists but with minimal coverage.<br>0: No logging or monitoring implemented.|
